# Keras_MLP
Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML.[2][3][4] Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible. It was developed as part of the research effort of project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System),[5] and its primary author and maintainer is Fran√ßois Chollet, a Google engineer. Chollet also is the author of the XCeption deep neural network model.[6]
